#	All scene objects have a name and parameters.
#		Each parameter is separated by "|" characters.
#
#	There should be no whitespaces between the beginning of the name
#		and the end of its last parameter.
#
#	In order to comment out a line, you need to put a "#" character at the
#		beginning(not counting whitespace characters), as you might guess.
#
#	To the scene you can put objects like these:
#		Camera:
#			camera (there should be only one or zero on the scene)
#		Shapes:
#			plane
#			sphere
#			cone
#			cylinder
#		Lights:
#			ambient (there should be only one or zero on the scene)
#			light
#
#	Objects names are case-INsensitive.
#
#	For one line - one object.
#
#	All other non-empty strings throw an "Unknown string" exception.
#
#	If the scene has no light, an error exception about it will be thrown.
#
#	Numbers:	Maximum number length (counting by characters): 9
#				You can write a double number, both 0.1 and .1
#		Examples: 100, 0.1, .01 and -10 have the same length.
#
#	Vectors:	Vectors have three numbers separated by commas without spaces.
#		Examples: 0,0,0 or -1.4,4563,.4
#
#	Colors:		Colors have a HEX format(case-insenitive):
#
#	Length:| 	  Three ways			 Two ways				  One way
